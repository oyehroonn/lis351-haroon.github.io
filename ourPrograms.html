            <h2>Our Programs</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1. HAH - Help a Human Program: This program is dedicated to showcasing the stories of individuals who are in need of assistance with their daily struggles, whether they're financial or physical. From providing essential food supplies to helping repair household items, every contribution counts. Through HAH, donors have the opportunity to directly impact someone's life by offering support where it's needed most.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2. DAB - Donate A Book Program: Our Donate A Book Program aims to build a community library filled with donated books from generous individuals like you. Whether it's a book you've finished reading or one that's been collecting dust on your shelf, your donation can find a new home and a new reader through our platform. By connecting donors with those seeking literature, we're fostering a love for reading and knowledge-sharing. Join us in spreading the joy of reading and learning through the power of donated books.</p>

            <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3. PAT - Plant a Tree Program: Our plant a tree program would give points to our donors or members whoever join our community if they plant a tree. Plant a tree and save lives and our environment</p>
